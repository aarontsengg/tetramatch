idea: 

we would do something like zengrams, where u get to build a puzzle then have people solve it 

pieces avaiable:
1x1
1x2
1x3
1x4
L pieces, both right and left 
3x3
2x2
t pieces 
u can rotate ur pieces however u like (rotating already symmetric pieces won't do anything)



u have option to color code ur pieces 

to solve: the participant will be given pieces equal to the pieces u spent to create the picture 
the participant will also be given the board, with any unused spaces turned into blanks, not to be included 

Creator side:
    - sandbox mode, where u have access to unlimited pieces 
    - u can rotate and color code them however u like 
participant side:
    - limited amount of pieces given 
        - pieces become greyed out when the count left is 0 
    - can rotate however u like
    - also can color code them however? 

API:
- rotateBlock(right) - where right is a boolean representing a right rotation or not 
- selectBlock(selected) - used when user selects block to use 
- placeBlock(x, y) - attempt to place block at location. Error if covers another block 
    - also will call createBlock() which returns an array of transforms if u have capacity, or -1 if no more avaiable 
    - create error message banner? idk, maybe flash red or something small 
    - createBlock() returns an array of transforms that placeBlock can use, based on the rotations of the selected. 
- removeBlock(x, y) - removes a block at that location. Requires id of block to remove all, DFS style. 
- clearBoard() - clears the board of all colors, and sets idCounter to 0
- selectColor(color) - used when user selects a color to use 


options:
canvas size
    - 8x8
    - 16x16
    - 32x32 

What's left to do:
    
 - Make display screen look better 
 - Maybe cache the api calls because its getting kinda slow with every post. 
 - Literally doesn't change, so we can cache everything
